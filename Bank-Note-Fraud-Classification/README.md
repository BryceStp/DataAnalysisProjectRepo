# Notes: 
1. This is a final project I did for one of my courses a while back, where we were tasked wth using logistic regression and gradient descent in order to discern if certain bank notes were fraudulent or not. 
2. The data is from the Bank Note Authentication UCI data set. 
3. Data was extracted from images that were taken of genuine and forged banknotes.
