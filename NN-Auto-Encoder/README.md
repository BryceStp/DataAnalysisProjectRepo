# Notes:
1. The data is too big for me to upload to github, so it can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.
2. This project is on Credit Card Fraud (once again), except we are using a different data set and working with an auto encoder.
3. Here we take advantage of Keras (gpu version is recommended in this instance) to construct an auto encoder.
