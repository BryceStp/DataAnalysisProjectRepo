1. This is a relatively short project I did with a few classmates a while back on kmeans and clustering.   
2. This is a usps dataset of handwritten numbers that have been grey scaled. 
3. The first column in the csv is the value of the digit it represents. 
4. Each row is 256 pixels saved from left to right, top to bottom forming a 16x16 square and each pixel has an intensity which ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 is the darkest.
